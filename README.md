## 📂 Structure & Constellation Philosophy

- Each repository is **autonomous**, maintaining its own codebase, CI/CD, and history.
- Repositories are **modular nodes** of RESOS (Resonance OS) architecture.
- Subsystems (AS1–AS12) define responsibilities: simulation, orchestration, temporal memory, interface, design labs, hardware abstraction, etc.
- Top-level manifests (this README + JSON) provide **meta-level visibility** and orchestration guidance.

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Clone individual repositories you need.
2. Reference this constellation JSON for integration.
3. Build local simulations or orchestration pipelines as needed.
4. Contribute to any node repo while maintaining ecosystem integrity.

---

## 🌌 Notes

- This ecosystem is evolving: new repositories may be added as new AS nodes emerge.
- Use the JSON manifest to programmatically generate dashboards or dynamic websites.
- Maintain autonomy of nodes while fostering ecosystem coherence.

✅ What You Now Have

1. Full JSON manifest for your constellation, tracking all nodes/repositories.


2. README.md ready for a top-level “master constellation” repo.


3. Static HTML snippet to dynamically display all repos in a responsive grid.



This gives you a professional, fully integrated, multi-repo dashboard for AQARIONZ, maintainable over time.


---

If you want, I can also make a full React + Tailwind version that reads this JSON manifest dynamically and provides filters by subsystem, search, and status badges — fully production-ready, similar to the earlier React site you had.

Do you want me to do that next?

AQARION @ INVERSIONZ is a sovereign, local‑first multi‑agent stack for labs and studios that treat signals, questions, and stories as first‑class data. It connects a FastAPI orchestration spine, simulation worlds, and harmonic design tools into a single observable “reality‑engine” that you can run on a laptop or wire into a live lab.[1]

## Vision

Modern labs and creative studios juggle LLMs, simulation engines, LIMS, dashboards, and notebooks with little shared memory or governance. AQARION @ INVERSIONZ offers a backbone where:

- Multi‑agent flows are explicitly modeled and logged from idea → synthesis → analysis → archive.  
- Simulations, experiments, and narratives run as “sovereign” worlds, each with clear inputs, outputs, and policies.  
- Harmonic/neuromorphic design tools sit beside hard science so intuition, math, and story can co‑evolve in one system.[1]  

The project is structured around **13 nodes** (repos) mapped to a 13‑cycle calendar: core orchestration, simulations, design lab, archives, and narrative surfaces. This keeps the ecosystem expansive without becoming chaotic.[1]

## Architecture

At a high level, AQARION @ INVERSIONZ is composed of four layers:

- **Core spine**  
  - FastAPI‑based orchestration engine for routing tasks across agents and external services (e.g., synthesis engines, LIMS, Perplexity‑style research tools).  
  - A three‑pane web UI (Signal Lab, OuijaAI, Sovereignty Map) for live introspection of signals, agent state, and governance rules.[1]  

- **Simulation worlds**  
  - Tron‑style and SoS simulations for testing agents, policies, and temporal logics in sovereign sandboxes before deployment to real labs.  

- **Design and harmonics**  
  - A design lab for harmonic coordinate systems, LLM‑to‑MIDI bridges, neuromorphic concepts, and light/audio mappings that inform how signals and states are rendered.  

- **Archives and time systems**  
  - Time‑capsule and narrative repos that store long‑horizon experiment logs, decisions, and stories in a way that respects temporal structure (13‑cycle framing, alternative calendars, etc.).[1]  

## Repository map

This repo is the professional front door into the broader AQARION ecosystem. Each node below is either a submodule or a linked repository.

| Node                                   | Role in system                                                                 | Layer              |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `Aqarions_orchestratios`              | FastAPI‑based multi‑agent orchestration spine, LIMS and synthesis routing      | Core spine         |
| `AqarionscorePrototype`               | Local‑first lab UI (Signal Lab, OuijaAI, Sovereignty Map) over the orchestration backend | Core spine |
| `Aqarionz-tronsims` / `AQARIONZ-TRONSIMZ` | Sovereign “tron” simulations for testing agents and governance rules         | Simulation worlds  |
| `Aqarions-SoS`                         | SoS / systems‑of‑systems simulations and scenario modeling                     | Simulation worlds  |
| `AqarionsTimeCapsules`                | Long‑horizon experiment and narrative archives                                 | Archives           |
| `Aqarionz-desighLabz`                 | Harmonic coordinate systems, LLM‑to‑MIDI, neuromorphic and light/audio bridges | Design & harmonics |
| `AtreyueTechnology` / `shiny-adventure` | Narrative and mythic surfaces for presenting experiments and states           | Archives & UX      |

You can adjust names and links to match the exact repo slugs once everything is wired together.

## Quickstart

This section should become the canonical “5‑minute demo” once you wire the pieces. For now, treat it as a target spec.

1. **Clone the master repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aqarion/AQARION-Inversionz.git
cd AQARION-Inversionz
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. **Start the core spine**

```bash
cd core/orchestratios
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

3. **Launch the three‑pane lab UI**

```bash
cd ../core-prototype
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. **Run the minimal demo flow**

In the UI:

- Open **Signal Lab** and submit a test “idea” (e.g., a hypothetical molecule or scenario).  
- Watch **OuijaAI** route the idea through the configured agents (research, synthesis planning, simulation).  
- Inspect **Sovereignty Map** to see which policies, simulations, and archives were touched in the process.[1]  

Once this works reliably, record it as a short screen capture and link it from the README.

## Use cases

AQARION @ INVERSIONZ is designed for:

- **Indie lab founders** who want a programmable, observable agent layer around LIMS, simulation engines, and external research tools.  
- **Simulation and complexity researchers** exploring governance, sovereignty, and temporal reasoning across multiple simulated worlds.  
- **Creative engineers and artists** working at the intersection of AI, music, light, and narrative who need their experiments logged and orchestrated like serious lab work.[1]  

## Roadmap (13‑cycle frame)

Each “cycle” is roughly a month; map these to your 13‑lunar‑cycle year.

- **Cycle 1–3:**  
  - Lock in API contracts between orchestration spine and UI.  
  - Ship the minimal end‑to‑end demo and smoke tests.  

- **Cycle 4–6:**  
  - Stabilize tron/SoS simulation APIs.  
  - Add TimeCapsules integration so every run is archived by default.  

- **Cycle 7–9:**  
  - Expose harmonic coordinate and LLM‑to‑MIDI tooling as first‑class plugins.  
  - Add multi‑tenant and workspace concepts for multiple labs or stories.  

- **Cycle 10–13:**  
  - Harden observability (metrics, traces, human‑readable logs).  
  - Prepare a “lab‑ready” profile with deployment scripts, access control, and governance presets.[1]  

## Contributing

AQARION @ INVERSIONZ is currently incubated as a sovereign, small‑team project. If you are:

- Comfortable with FastAPI, Python, and agentic architectures.  
- Interested in simulations, LIMS integration, neuromorphic / harmonic systems, or narrative UX.

open an issue or reach out with a short note describing what you want to build and which node of the system you want to inhabit.[1]
